		<p>Tsuki-tag is an aggregated anime imageboard browser and collection manager, which lets you browse multiple image sources in a combined view, search images using tags, download images into configured workspaces (folders) with customization and filename templating support, and manage or curate multiple collections of your chosen images.</p>
		<p>Tsuki-tag can inject EXIF metadata information (tag, image attributes, copyright notice, etc.) into the images during downloading or saving, with an additional option to convert non-JPG images to JPG images which support EXIF metadata. This could provide artists with a great way of creating and organizing a collection of images for reference, or to manage and appropriately annotate their own images with author and copyright information.</p>
		<p>Features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Browse an aggregated collection of images retrieved from a number of pre-configured image providers in a paginated view. </li>
			<li> Fine-tune which providers are queried, along with what type of images should be shown ('safe', 'questionable', 'explicit'). </li>
			<li> Search for images using tags and tag combinations with wildcard support, exclude images from being displayed using another set of tags with wildcard and regular expression support. </li>
			<li> Hover over images for a quick look at their attributes and information, or select them to keep them available for batch operations. </li>
			<li> Open images in separate tabs and continue browsing. </li>
			<li> Multi-selection system with support for batch operations (batch add to / remove from workspaces and online lists, batch update or annotate). </li>
			<li> Create online lists, which are a local collection of image metadata which can be browsed just as the online providers. </li>
			<li> Create workspaces, which on top of the features of online lists, lets you download images to configured folders with customizable behavior. </li>
			<li> Import local files or folders to workspaces, or convert one of your image folders to a workspace. </li>
			<li> Create metadata groups, which are a collection of information such as author, copyright notice, description and notes, which can be directly injected into the EXIF metadata of the JPG images files during workspace operations. </li>
			<li> Convert non-JPG images to JPG for EXIF support. </li>
			<li> Add, edit, or remove image tags before workspace or online list operations. </li>
			<li> Create tag rules for your online lists or workspaces with wildcard and regular expression support, to automatically process an image across multiple lists. </li>
			<li> Automatically add or remove tags when an image is added to, or removed from a workspace or online list, with templating support. </li>
			<li> Specify the file names of files to be downloaded to a workspace, with templating support. </li>
			<li> Global tag blacklisting with wildcard and regular expression support. </li>
			<li> Several other features such as opening images in your default image editor, opening or copying the image website URL, re-downloading the image from the original provider, and more. </li>
